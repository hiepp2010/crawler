John Stuart Mill,"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.

John Stuart Mill,"He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one of imitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his faculties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision. "
John Stuart Mill,"No one can be a great thinker who does not recognize that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusions it may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with due study, and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions of those who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think."
John Stuart Mill,"The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily, or mental or spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, than by compelling each to live as seems good to the rest."
John Stuart Mill,"The only freedom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it."

Jeff Melvoin,"You think Nature is some Disney movie? Nature is a killer. Nature is a bitch. It's feeding time out there 24 hours a day, every step that you take is a gamble with death.

Art, to whatever degree we can get a handle on (I'm not sure that we really can) is a process. It begins in the heart and the mind with the eyes and hands."
Jeff Melvoin,"Talking perceptions, people. Do we really see each other for what we really are, or do we just see what we want to see, the image distorted by our own personal lenses? I lost someone today and the funny thing is, I don't even know who she was."

Peter McWilliams,"Acceptance is not a state of passivity or inaction. I am not saying you can't change the world, right wrongs, or replace evil with good.

Peter McWilliams,"Pain (any pain--emotional, physical, mental) has a message. The information it has about our life can be remarkably specific, but it usually falls into one of two categories: ""We would be more alive if we did more of this,"" and, ""Life would be more lovely if we did less of that."" Once we get the pain's message, and follow its advice, the pain goes away."
Peter McWilliams,Resentment is anger directed at others--at what they did or did not do.
Peter McWilliams,"Stubbornness is also determination. It's simply a matter of shifting from ""won't power"" to ""will power."""

William McDonough,Don't get me wrong: I love nuclear energy! It's just that I prefer fusion to fission. And it just so happens that there's an enormous fusion reactor safely banked a few million miles from us. It delivers more than we could ever use in just about 8 minutes. And it's wireless!

Orison Swett Marden,"We lift ourselves by our thought, we climb upon our vision of ourselves. If you want to enlarge your life, you must first enlarge your thought of it and of yourself.

Rock and roll is about shaking things up, making people act and react. That's what I do."

And they've got these wild stories about me, completely off the wall, completely untrue. They thought them up and it makes you wonder what goes on in their brain, but of course, they don't consider themselves sick. They think they're normal because they don't dress like I do."

Horace Mann,Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity.
Joseph L. Mankiewicz,"Funny business, a woman's career: the things you drop on the way up the ladder so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you get back to being a woman. It's one career all females have in common, whether we like it or not: being a woman. Sooner or later, we've got to work at it, no matter how many other careers we've had or wanted."
John Mankiewicz,"Enough organization, enough lists and we think we can control the uncontrollable."

Og Mandino,"Love doesn't sit there like a stone, it has to be made, like bread: remade all the time, made new."
Og Mandino,"Never again clutter your days or nights with so many menial and unimportant things that you have no time to accept a real challenge when it comes along. This applies to play as well as work. A day merely survived is no cause for celebration. You are not here to fritter away your precious hours when you have the ability to accomplish so much by making a slight change in your routine. No more busy work. No more hiding from success. Leave time, leave space, to grow. Now. Now! Not tomorrow!"
Og Mandino,"Realize that true happiness lies within you. Waste no time and effort searching for peace and contentment and joy in the world outside. Remember that there is no happiness in having or in getting, but only in giving. Reach out. Share. Smile. Hug. Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few drops on yourself."
Og Mandino,Sound character provides the power with which a person may ride the emergencies of life instead of being overwhelmed by them. Failure is... the highway to success.
Og Mandino,"Take the attitude of a student, never be too big to ask questions, never know too much to learn something new."
Og Mandino,"The person who knows one thing and does it better than anyone else, even if it only be the art of raising lentils, receives the crown he merits. If he raises all his energy to that end, he is a benefactor of mankind and its rewarded as such."
Og Mandino,"The victory of success is half won when one gains the habit of setting goals and achieving them. Even the most tedious chore will become endurable as you parade through each day convinced that every task, no matter how menial or boring, brings you closer to fulfilling your dreams."
Og Mandino,To be always intending to make a new and better life but never to find time to set about it is as to put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day to the next until you're dead.

Andre Malraux,"Be careful -- with quotations, you can damn anything."

Norman Mailer,Every moment of one's existence one is growing into more or retreating into less.
Norman Mailer,One thing I've learned in all these years is not to make love when you really don't feel it; there's probably nothing worse you can do to yourself than that.
Norman Mailer,"Part of the ability to keep writing over the years comes down to living with the expectation of disappointment. It's the exact opposite of capitalism. In capitalism you want your business to succeed, and to the degree it does your energy increases, and you go out and buy an even bigger business. In writing it's almost the exact opposite. You just want to keep the store going. You're not going to do as well this year as last year probably, but nonetheless let's keep the store going. What ruins most writers of talent is that they don't get enough experience, so their novels tend to develop a certain paranoid perfection."
Norman Mailer,Sentimentality is the emotional promiscuity of those who have no sentiment.
Norman Mailer,The function of socialism is to raise suffering to a higher level.

Sidney Madwed,Words can be like baseball bats when used maliciously.
Madonna,"I'm tough, I'm ambitious, and I know exactly what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay."
Madonna,Poor is the man whose pleasures depend on the permission of another.
Madonna,"That consciousness is everything and that all things begin with a thought. That we are responsible for our own fate, we reap what we sow, we get what we give, we pull in what we put out. I know these things for sure."
Madonna,"To be brave is to love someone unconditionally, without expecting anything in return. To just give. That takes courage, because we don't want to fall on our faces or leave ourselves open to hurt."
James Madison,I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.
James Madison,"If men were angels, no government would be necessary."
James Madison,"The essence of government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse."
James Madison,"Since the general civilization of mankind, I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people, by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations."
James Madison,"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself."
Sri Madhava,"Freedom, then, lies only in our innate human capacity to choose between different sorts of bondage, bondage to desire or self esteem, or bondage to the light that lightens all our lives."
Ambrosius Macrobius,Good laws have their origins in bad morals.
Agnes Macphail,"Do not rely completely on any other human being, however dear.  We meet all life's greatest tests alone. "
Harold Macmillan,"I have never found, in a long experience of politics, that criticism is ever inhibited by ignorance."
Ian Macleod,History is too serious to be left to historians.
Hugh Macleod,"Good ideas alter the power balance in relationships, that is why good ideas are always initially resisted. Good ideas come with a heavy burden. Which is why so few people have them. So few people can handle it."
Hugh Macleod,"There's no correlation between creativity and equipment ownership. None. Zilch. Nada. Actually, as the artist gets more into his thing, and as he gets more successful, his number of tools tends to go down. He knows what works for him. Expending mental energy on stuff wastes time."
Hugh Macleod,All existing business models are wrong. Find a new one.
Hugh Macleod,Question how much freedom your path affords you. Be utterly ruthless about it.
Hugh Macleod, It's your freedom that will get you to where you want to go.
Hugh Macleod,"The pain of making the necessary sacrifices always hurts more than you think it's going to. I know. It sucks. That being said, doing something seriously creative is one of the most amazing experiences one can have, in this or any other lifetime. If you can pull it off, it's worth it. Even if you don't end up pulling it off, you'll learn many incredible, magical, valuable things. It's NOT doing it when you know you full well you HAD the opportunity- that hurts FAR more than any failure."
Hugh Macleod,Never compare your inside with somebody else's outside.
Hugh Macleod,"The first rule of business, is never sell something you love. Otherwise, you may as well be selling your children."
Hugh Macleod,"The bars of West Hollywood and New York are awash with people throwing their lives away in the desperate hope of finding a shortcut, any shortcut. And a lot of them aren't even young anymore; their B-plans having been washed away by Vodka & Tonics years ago."
Hugh Macleod," Meanwhile their competition is at home, working their asses off."
Hugh Macleod,"Art suffers the moment other people start paying for it. The more you need the money, the more people will tell you what to do. The less control you will have. The more bullshit you will have to swallow. The less joy it will bring. Know this and plan accordingly."
Hugh Macleod,"When I see somebody 'suffering for their art', it%uFFFDs usually a case of them not knowing where that red line is, not knowing where the sovereignty lies."
Hugh Macleod,The old ways are dead. And you need people around you who concur.
Hugh Macleod," That means hanging out more with the creative people, the freaks, the real visionaries, than you're already doing. Thinking more about what their needs are, and responding accordingly. Avoid the dullards; avoid the folk who play it safe. They can't help you any more. Their stability model no longer offers that much stability. They are extinct, they are extinction."
Hugh Macleod,"Part of understanding the creative urge is understanding that it's primal. Wanting to change the world is not a noble calling, it's a primal calling."
Hugh Macleod,The only people who can change the world are people who want to. And not everybody does.
Hugh Macleod,"Your idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to be yours alone. The more the idea is yours alone, the more freedom you have to do something really amazing. The more amazing, the more people will click with your idea. The more people click with your idea, the more it will change the world."
Hugh Macleod,Diluting your product to make it more 'commercial' will just make people like it less.
Hugh Macleod,"Everybody is too busy with their own lives to give a damn about your book, painting, screenplay etc, especially if you haven't sold it yet. And the ones that aren't, you don't want in your life anyway."
Hugh Macleod,It's about what YOU are going to do with the short time you have left on this earth.
Hugh Macleod,"If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. In the meantime, you%uFFFDre better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you don%uFFFDt feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation."
Hugh Macleod,"Neither should you fret too much about 'writer%uFFFDs block'. If you%uFFFDre looking at a blank piece of paper and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writer%uFFFDs block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something."
Hugh Macleod,"You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long."
Archibald MacLeish,"To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold."
Norman Maclean,It is those we live with and love and should know who elude us.
Norman Maclean,"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. I am haunted by waters."

Niccolo Machiavelli,"God creates men, but they choose each other."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"A prince should therefore have no other aim or thought, nor take up any other thing for his study but war and it organization and discipline, for that is the only art that is necessary to one who commands."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"He who has not first laid his foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"Men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, for everyone can see and few can feel. Every one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"There are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehend; and a third which neither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first is the most excellent, the second is good, and the third is useless."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"There is no other way of guarding oneself against flattery than by letting men understand that they will not offend you by speaking the truth; but when everyone can tell you the truth, you lose their respect."
Niccolo Machiavelli,"When neither their property nor their honor is touched, the marjority of men live content."

It should not be applied only to the most advanced cases, as is present practice. Whether the patient has a cardiac condition, hypertension, autoimmune disease, fibroids, or asthma, he or she must be informed that fasting and natural, plant-based diets are a viable alternative to conventional therapy, and an effective one. The time may come when not offering this substantially more effective nutritional approach will be considered malpractice."

Everybody goes about the business of acting like their lives matter and then, no matter how important the events of the day end up being, the sun invariably sets.

You see people and things; some are familiar; some are strange. You talk, you feel, but you move without walking; you fly without wings. Your mind and your body exist, but on separate planes. Time stands still. For me, this is the feeling I have when ideas come."
Lynn Johnston,"The toughest question has always been, ""How do you get your ideas?"" How do you answer that? It's like asking runners how they run, or singers how they sing. They just do it!"
Lynn Johnston,"We are all born with wonderful gifts. We use these gifts to express ourselves, to amuse, to strengthen, and to communicate. We begin as children to explore and develop our talents, often unaware that we are unique, that not everyone can do what we're doing!"

Steve Jobs,"Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can't do is ignore them because they change things... they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."
Steve Jobs,I think we're having fun. I think our customers really like our products. And we're always trying to do better.
Steve Jobs,"In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains of the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.

Steve Jobs,"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."
Steve Jobs,I'm the only person I know that's lost a quarter of a billion dollars in one year.... It's very character-building.
Steve Jobs,Every good product I've ever seen is because a group of people cared deeply about making something wonderful that they and their friends wanted. They wanted to use it themselves.
Steve Jobs,"I don't think it's good that we're perceived as different I think it's important we're perceived as MUCH BETTER. If being different is essential to doing that, then we have to do that, but if we could be much better without being different, that'd be fine with me. I want to be much better! I don't care about being different, but we'll have to be different in some ways to be much better."
Steve Jobs,"I'm sure a lot of you had this experience when you're changing. You're growing as a person and people tend to treat you like you were 18 months ago, and it's really frustrating sometimes when you're growing up and you're more capable. It's the same thing with a company and the press. The press is going to have a lag time. The best thing we can do about the press is embrace them and do the best thing we can to educate them about our strategy. But to keep our eye on the prize, that is turning out some great products. the press and the stock prize will take care of themselves."
Steve Jobs,"The hardest thing when you think about focusing. You think focusing is about saying ""Yes."" No. Focusing is about saying ""No."" And when you say ""No,"" you piss off people."

Penn Jillette,My favorite thing about the Internet is that you get to go into the private world of real creeps without having to smell them.
Penn Jillette,"Technology adds nothing to art. Two thousand years ago, I could tell you a story, and at any point during the story I could stop, and ask, Now do you want the hero to be kidnapped, or not? But that would, of course, have ruined the story. Part of the experience of being entertained is sitting back and plugging into someone else's vision."

Ward Jenkins,"Photographers do this for a living, every single day -- they point their lenses toward every single corner of our world and somehow make the mundane mesmerizing through their artistic eye. It's all a matter of being aware of your surroundings and realizing that there are some really amazing and interesting things to look at, even if it may just be something so simple as a wall being covered up by paint."
Ward Jenkins,"I know just how frustrating it can be when you're tired and exhausted, but you still want to draw something."

Claudia Jewett Jarrett,It is the caring and sharing that count—love is not prevented by the things and the time that you haven’t shared.
Claudia Jewett Jarrett,One of the common causes of serious difficulty takes the form of parental self-discovery. The newly adopted child brings out submerged feelings or behavior in his parents that make them dislike themselves. This can be such a severe blow to their self- esteem that they must eradicate the cause of their distress. Sometimes the only way that parents are able to do that is by returning the child.

William James,The most immutable barrier in nature is between one man's thoughts and another's.
William James,"The stream of thought flows on; but most of its segments fall into the bottomless abyss of oblivion. Of some, no memory survives the instant of their passage. Of others, it is confined to a few moments, hours or days. Others, again, leave vestiges which are indestructible, and by means of which they may be recalled as long as life endures."

Scott R. Kurtz,"If I've learned one thing in the 14 years I've been a full-time cartoonist, it's that you can not let anyone else define your professionalism.

But the only time that is surely yours is the present, hence this is the time to speak the word of appreciation and sympathy, to do the generous deed, to forgive the fault of a thoughtless friend, to sacrifice self a little more for others. Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart, to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed, and to use your God-given abilities for the enrichment of someone less fortunate.

Stephanie Klein,"I'd heard it all the time, 'Live in the moment.' But if I did that, I'd weigh more than a dump truck. Losing weight wasn't about the moment at all; it was about having faith in the future. It was about knowing there would be another meal in a few hours."

Stephen King,"You can approach the act of writing with nervousness, excitement, hopefulness, or even despairâ€“the sense that you can never completely put on the page whatâ€™s in your mind and heart. You can come to the act with your fists clenched and your eyes narrowed, ready to kick ass and take down names. You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page."

Most likely isn't going to fund terrorists, but pot makes you feel fine with being bored and it's when you're bored that you should be learning a new skill or some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you're not good at anything."

So I guess what I'm feeling is like a beautiful sadness."

Theodore Parker,Magnificent promises are always to be suspected.

For such is the immensity of man that he is greater than heaven and earth."

If this might be the last time they saw you, they really saw you. People listened instead of just waiting for their turn to speak. And when they spoke, they weren't telling you a story. When the two of you talked, you were building something, and afterward you were both different than before."
Chuck Palahniuk,We just had a near-life experience!

Larry Page,"The moments that we have with friends and family, the chances that we have to make a big difference in the world or even to make a small difference to the ones we love, all those wonderful chances that life gives us, life also takes away. It can happen fast and a whole lot sooner than you think."
Larry Page,"You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream?

The easiest way to drop this hot potato was to invest it, to buy shares. I knew that World War II was coming and I was afraid that if I had shares which rise in case of war, I would wish for war. So I asked my agent to buy shares which go down in the event of war. This he did. I lost my money and saved my soul."

The largest property may be wrested from a child, but virtue will stand by him to the last."
Charles Sumner,From the beginning of our history the country has been afflicted with compromise. It is by compromise that human rights have been abandoned. I insist that this shall cease.

Meryl Streep,Empathy is at the heart of the actor's art.

Meryl Streep,"This is your time and it feels normal to you, but really, there is no normal. There's only change and resistance to it and then more change."
Meryl Streep,"We change who we are to fit the exogenous of our time, and not just strategically or to our own advantage, sometimes sympathetically without our even knowing it for the betterment of the whole group."

Igor Stravinsky,"The past slips from our grasp. It leaves us only scattered things. The bond that united them eludes us. Our imagination usually fills in the void by making use of preconceived theories...Archaeology, then, does not supply us with certitudes, but rather with vague hypotheses. And in the shade of these hypotheses some artists are content to dream, considering them less as scientific facts than as sources of inspiration."

When I look for religion, I must look for something above me, and not something beneath."

Clifford Stoll,I sense an insatiable demand for connectivity. Maybe all these people have discovered important uses for the Internet. Perhaps some of them feel hungry for a community that our real neighborhoods don't deliver. At least a few must wonder what the big deal is.
Clifford Stoll,I spend almost as much time figuring out what's wrong with my computer as I do actually using it.

I had seen the roller coaster of my father's career - top of the world, then unemployed - and I never wanted to take a job because I needed money."
Joss Whedon,You go to movies to see people you love suffer - that's why you go to the movies. You don't go to see a movie about a guy who already knows he has a wonderful life.
Joss Whedon,"Everything is a drug. Family, art, causes, new shoes... We're all just tweaking our chem to avoid the void."
Wil Wheaton,I'm keenly aware of the Pride coming before the Fall . . . but I really do like what I've been able to do here.
Wil Wheaton,Don’t let the fear of not pleasing someone stop you from being creative.
Wil Wheaton,"If you enjoyed making a thing, and you’re proud of the thing you made, that’s enough. Not everyone is going to like it, and that’s okay."
Wil Wheaton,"Sometimes, a person who likes your work and a person who don’t will show up within milliseconds of each other to let you know how they feel. One does not need to cancel out the other, positively or negatively; if you’re proud of the work, and you enjoyed the work, that is what’s important."
Wil Wheaton,"The goal isn’t to make something everyone will love; the goal is to get excited, and make a thing where something wasn’t before."
Wil Wheaton,"I don’t know what the future of my career holds, but I know that whatever is over the horizon, the road I’ve traveled to get here is like those Interstates in Texas: everything can look the same, and it can feel like you’re not going anywhere, until you suddenly get where you’re going and realize that you’ve been traveling for a long time."
Wil Wheaton,Don't be a dick!
Wil Wheaton,"Keep playing games. Make time to play games with your friends and family, because it's surprisingly heartbreaking to wipe a thin layer of dust off a game you love, before you put it back on the shelf because the real world is calling you."
Margaret Wheatley,"When we seek for connection, we restore the world to wholeness. Our seemingly separate lives become meaningful as we discover how truly necessary we are to each other."
Richard Whatley,He who is not aware of his ignorance will only be misled by his knowledge.
Edith Wharton,"A classic is classic not because it conforms to certain structural rules, or fits certain definitions (of which its author had quite probably never heard). It is classic because of a certain eternal and irrepressible freshness."
Edith Wharton,"After all, one knows one's weak points so well, that it's rather bewildering to have the critics overlook them and invent others."
Edith Wharton,"Another unsettling element in modern art is that common symptom of immaturity, the dread of doing what has been done before."
Edith Wharton,"Art is on the side of the oppressed. Think before you shudder at the simplistic dictum and its heretical definition of the freedom of art. For if art is freedom of the spirit, how can it exist within the oppressors?"
Edith Wharton,"Habit is necessary; it is the habit of having habits, of turning a trail into a rut, that must be incessantly fought against if one is to remain alive."
Edith Wharton,"How much longer are we going to think it necessary to be ''American'' before (or in contradistinction to) being cultivated, being enlightened, being humane, and having the same intellectual discipline as other civilized countries?"
Edith Wharton,I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views.
Edith Wharton,"I wonder, among all the tangles of this mortal coil, which one contains tighter knots to undo, and consequently suggests more tugging, and pain, and diversified elements of misery, than the marriage tie."
Edith Wharton,If only we'd stop trying to be happy we could have a pretty good time.
Edith Wharton,"In spite of illness, in spite even of the archenemy sorrow, one can remain alive long past the usual date of disintegration if one is unafraid of change, insatiable in intellectual curiosity, interested in big things, and happy in small ways."
Edith Wharton,Life is the only real counselor; wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become a part of the moral tissue.
Edith Wharton,"Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty breadth of the universe, old age flowing free with the delicious near-by freedom of death."
Edith Wharton,The only way not to think about money is to have a great deal of it.
Edith Wharton,True originality consists not in a new manner but in a new vision.
Edith Wharton,"There are lots of ways of being miserable, but there's only one way of being comfortable, and that is to stop running round after happiness. If you make up your mind not to be happy there's no reason why you shouldn't have a fairly good time."
Edith Wharton,There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.
Scott Westerfeld,I guess sometimes you have to lie to find the truth.
Scott Westerfeld,"Turns out if you never lie, there's always someone mad at you."
Scott Westerfeld,Most men's awareness doesn't extend past their dinner plates.
Scott Westerfeld,High school wasn't a trial by fire or some ordeal that had to be survived. It was all a big joke. You just had to provide the laugh track.
Scott Westerfeld,Maybe kissing is sort of like nature's coffee.
Scott Westerfeld,"Not everything made you stronger. It was possible to survive, yet still be crippled for your trouble. Sometimes it was okay to run away, to skip the test, to chicken out. Or at least to get some help."
Scott Westerfeld,A little drama wins more friends than boring.
Scott Westerfeld,It's amazing how quickly nature consumes human places after we turn our backs on them. Life is a hungry thing.

Scott Westerfeld,The human heart is a strange vessel. Love and hatred can exist side by side.
Scott Westerfeld,"Everyone in the world was programmed by the place they were born, hemmed in by their beliefs, but you had to at least try to grow your own brain"

Scott Westerfeld,Freedom has a way of destroying things.
Scott Westerfeld,It doesn't take much convincing to make someone believe they're better than everyone else.
Scott Westerfeld,"Here's what I've learned about dogs: They're a lot like pretty girls. Having one or two around makes everything more fun, but when you get a whole bunch together, it turns into one big power struggle."
Scott Westerfeld,"I'd watched too many schoolmates graduate into mental institutions, into group homes and jails, and I knew that locking people up was paranormal - against normal, not beside it. Locks didn't cure; they strangled."
Scott Westerfeld,"Junkies might be easy to knock down, but they're never fragile. They have souls like old leather shoes studded with steel, and they're about as much good as friends."
Scott Westerfeld,"Money's the same, whoever gives it to you. That was the point of money, after all: crisp and clean or wrinkled or disintegrated into quarters - a dollar was always worth a hundred cents."
Scott Westerfeld,We don't always get to choose what we love.
Scott Westerfeld,Hard work's a good distraction.
Cynthia Ozick,"I'm not afraid of facts, I welcome facts but a congeries of facts is not equivalent to an idea. This is the essential fallacy of the so-called ""scientific"" mind. People who mistake facts for ideas are incomplete thinkers; they are gossips."
Cynthia Ozick,Nothing is so awesomely unfamiliar as the familiar that discloses itself at the end of a journey.
Cynthia Ozick,To imagine the unimaginable is the highest use of the imagination.
Cynthia Ozick,To want to be what one can be is purpose in life.

George Orwell,"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen."
George Orwell,All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.
George Orwell,"A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: 1. What am I trying to say? 2. What words will express it? 3. What image or idiom will make it clearer? 4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?"
George Orwell,"In certain kinds of writing, particularly in art criticism and literary criticism, it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning."
George Orwell,"Political language -- and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists -- is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind."
George Orwell,"The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink."
George Orwell,People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.
George Orwell,"If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable – what then?"
George Orwell,"War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent."
George Orwell,The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it.
Joe Orton,I'd the upbringing a nun would envy and that's the truth. Until I was fifteen I was more familiar with Africa than my own body.
Suze Orman,It's better to do nothing with your money than something you don't understand.
Peggy Orenstein,"And isn't that, at it's core, what the princess fantasy is about for all of us? ""Princess"" is how we tell little girls that they are special, precious. ""Princess"" is the wish that we could protect them from pain, that they would never know sorrow, that they will live happily ever after ensconces in lace and innocence."
Peggy Orenstein,"It's not that pink is intrinsically bad, but it is such a tiny slice of the rainbow, and, though it may celebrate girlhood in one way, it also repeatedly and firmly fuses girl's identity to appearance."
Robert Orben,"I take my children everywhere, but they always find their way back home."

Sharon Olds,"The older I get, the more I feel "
Sharon Olds, almost beautiful...
David M. Ogilvy,A good advertisement is one which sells the product without drawing attention to itself.
David M. Ogilvy,"In the modern world of business, it is useless to be a creative original thinker unless you can also sell what you create. Management cannot be expected to recognize a good idea unless it is presented to them by a good salesman."
David M. Ogilvy,Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine.
David M. Ogilvy,Political advertising ought to be stopped. It's the only really dishonest kind of advertising that's left.
David M. Ogilvy,The best ideas come as jokes. Make your thinking as funny as possible.
Charlton Ogburn,"We trained hard, but it seemed that every time we were beginning to form up into teams we would be reorganized. Presumably the plans for our employment were being changed. I was to learn later in life that, perhaps because we are so good at organizing, we tend as a nation to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency, and demoralization."
Augustus Octavius,"Practice, the master of all things."
William Ockham,"Never increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything."
Joyce Carol Oates,"If you explore beneath shyness or party chit-chat, you can sometimes turn a dull exchange into an intriguing one.

P. J. O'Rourke,The mystery of government is not how Washington works but how to make it stop.
P. J. O'Rourke,"The U.S. Constitution is less than a quarter the length of the owner's manual for a 1998 Toyota Camry, and yet it has managed to keep 300 million of the world's most unruly, passionate and energetic people safe, prosperous and free."
P. J. O'Rourke,"The weirder you are going to behave, the more normal you should look. It works in reverse, too. When I see a kid with three or four rings in his nose, I know there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about that person."
P. J. O'Rourke,Very little is known of the Canadian country since it is rarely visited by anyone but the Queen and illiterate sport fishermen.
P. J. O'Rourke,"When buying and selling are controlled by legislation, the first things to be bought and sold are legislators."
P. J. O'Rourke,With Epcot Center the Disney corporation has accomplished something I didn't think possible in today's world. They have created a land of make-believe that's worse than regular life.
P. J. O'Rourke,"There's a whiff of the lynch mob or the lemming migration about any overlarge concentration of like-thinking individuals, no matter how virtuous their cause."
P. J. O'Rourke,The purpose of a funeral service is to comfort the living. It is important at a funeral to display excessive grief. This will show others how kind-hearted and loving you are and their improved opinion of you will be very comforting.
Barack Obama,"Abraham Lincoln and Millard Fillmore had the same title. They were both presidents of the United States, but their tenure in office and their legacy could not be more different."
Barack Obama,"Acts of sacrifice and decency without regard to what's in it for you create ripple effects. Ones that lift up families and communities, that spread opportunity and boost our economy."
Barack Obama,Find somebody to be successful for. Raise their hopes. Think of their needs.
Barack Obama,"I know starting careers in troubled times is a challenge, but it is also a privilege. Because it's moments like these that force us to try harder, dig deeper and to discover gifts we never knew we had. To find the greatness that lies within each of us. So don't ever shy away from that endeavor. Don't stop adding to your body of work. I can promise that you will be the better for that continued effort as will be this nation that we all love."
Barack Obama,"I've come to embrace the notion that I haven't done enough in my life. I've come to confirm that one's title, even a title like president of the United States, says very little about how well one's life has been led. No matter how much you've done or how successful you've been, there's always more to do, always more to learn, and always more to achieve."
Barack Obama,"In recent years, we've become enamored with our own past success. Lulled into complacency by the glitter of our own achievements. We've become accustomed to the title of Military Superpower, forgetting the qualities that got us there. We've become accustomed to our economic dominance in the world, forgetting that it wasn't reckless deals and get rich quick schemes that got us where we are, but hard work and smart ideas, quality products and wise investments."
Barack Obama,"In this new, hyper competitive age, none of us, none of us can afford to be complacent."
Barack Obama,"That is the American story. People, just like you, following their passions, determined to meet the times on their own terms. They weren't doing it for the money. Their titles weren't fancy. But they changed the course of history and so can you."
Barack Obama,"That's what building a body of work is all about. It's about the daily labor, the many individual acts, the choices large and small that add up over time, over a lifetime to a lasting legacy. It's about not being satisfied with the latest achievement, the latest gold star, because the one thing I know about a body of work is that it's never finished. It's cumulative. It deepens and expands with each day you give your best. You may have setbacks and you may have failures, but you're not done. You haven't even started."
Barack Obama,"The elevation of appearance over substance, of celebrity over character, of short term gains over lasting achievement displays a poverty of ambition. It distracts you from what's truly important."
Barack Obama,"The leaders we revere and the businesses that last are generally not the result of a narrow pursuit of popularity or personal advancement, but of devotion to some bigger purpose. That's the hallmark of real success. The other trapping of success might be the by product of this larger mission, but it can't be the central thing."
Barack Obama,"We too often let the material things serve as indicators that we're doing well, even though something inside us tells us that were not doing our best. That we are avoiding that which is hard, but also necessary. That we are shrinking from rather than vising to the challenges of the age."
Barack Obama,You can't rest on your laurels. Your own body of work is yet to come.
Barack Obama,I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.
Barack Obama,"If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer."
Barack Obama,"There's new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair."
Barack Obama," The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there."
Barack Obama, There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.
Barack Obama," But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years — block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand."
Barack Obama,It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation.
Barack Obama, Yes we can.
Barack Obama, It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights.
Barack Obama, Yes we can.
Barack Obama, It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness.
Barack Obama, Yes we can.
Barack Obama,"We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. They will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks to come. We've been asked to pause for a reality check; we've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope."
Barack Obama,"America, we are better than these last eight years. We are a better country than this."
Barack Obama,We are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight.
Georgia O'Keeffe,"I said to myself, I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me - shapes and ideas so near to me - so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down. I decided to start anew, to strip away what I had been taught."
Georgia O'Keeffe,"Nobody sees a flower - really - it is so small it takes time - we haven't time - and to see takes time, like to have a friend takes time."

Austin O'Malley,Those that think it permissible to tell white lies soon grow color blind.

Sean O'Faolain,"There is only one admirable form of the imagination: the imagination that is so intense that it creates a new reality, that it makes things happen."
Kane O'Hara,"When the judgement's weak,"
Kane O'Hara, The prejudice is strong.
Flannery O'Connor,Everywhere I go I'm asked if I think the university stifles writers. My opinion is that they don't stifle enough of them. There's many a best-seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.
Flannery O'Connor,The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it.
Conan O'Brien,"Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you’re kind, amazing things will happen."
Conan O'Brien,"Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it’s my least favorite quality. It doesn’t lead anywhere."
Rosie O'Donnell,"I think the promise of fame and what it holds to you as a child and dreaming of it is not what it is. What it is, I'm not complaining about, but it's just different than the reality you dreamed."
Rosie O'Donnell,"It's going to come true like you knew it, but it's not going to feel like you think."
Sean O'Casey,All the world's a stage and most of us are desperately unrehearsed.

Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"Before we set our hearts too much upon anything, let us examine how happy those are who already possess it."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,Behind many acts that are thought ridiculous there lie wise and weighty motives.
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"Few are agreeable in conversation, because each thinks more of what he intends to say than of what others are saying, and listens no more when he himself has a chance to speak."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"Few things are impracticable in themselves; and it is for want of application, rather than of means, that men fail to succeed."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,Good advice is something a man gives when he is too old to set a bad example.
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,Gratitude is merely the secret hope of further favors.

Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"Many people despise wealth, but few know how to give it away."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,"Nothing is less sincere than our mode of asking and giving advice. He who asks seems to have a deference for the opinion of his friend, while he only aims to get approval of his own and make his friend responsible for his action. And he who gives advice repays the confidence supposed to be placed in him by a seemingly disinterested zeal, while he seldom means anything by his advice but his own interest or reputation."
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,One cannot answer for his courage when he has never been in danger. 
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,Our repentance is not so much regret for the ill we have done as fear of the ill that may happen to us in consequence.
Francois de La Rochefoucauld,Perfect courage means doing unwitnessed what he would be capable of with the world looking on.

Ann Richards,There is a lot more to life than just struggling to make money.

Alexis De Tocqueville,I have always noticed in politics how often men are ruined by having too good a memory.
Alexis De Tocqueville,The people reign over the American political world as God rules over the universe. It is the cause and the end of all things; everything rises out of it and is absorbed back into it.

James Thurber,"I used to wake up at 4 A.M. and start sneezing, sometimes for five hours. I tried to find out what sort of allergy I had but finally came to the conclusion that it must be an allergy to consciousness."

Anna Quindlen,"There's a certain kind of conversation you have from time to time at parties in New York about a new book.

The conversation goes around and around various literary criticisms, and by the time it moves on one thing is clear: No one read the book; we just read the reviews."
Anna Quindlen,"Voices that loud are always meant to bully. Do not be bullied. Acts of bravery don't always take place on battlefields. They can take place in your heart, when you have the courage to honor your character, your intellect, your inclinations, and, yes your soul by listening to its clean, clear voice of direction instead of following the muddied messages of a timid world."
Anna Quindlen,"When an actress takes off her clothes onscreen but a nursing mother is told to leave, what message do we send about the roles of women?

Dan Quayle,Murphy Brown is doing better than I am. At least she knows she still has a job next year.
Dan Quayle,The Holocaust was an obscene period in our nation's history. I mean in this century's history. But we all lived in this century. I didn't live in this century.

Margaret Thatcher,"To wear your heart on your sleeve isn't a very good plan; you should wear it inside, where it functions best."
Margaret Thatcher,"I think we've been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it's the government's job to cope with it. 'I have a problem, I'll get a grant.' 'I'm homeless, the government must house me.' They're casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first. It's our duty to look after ourselves and then, also to look after our neighbour. People have got the entitlements too much in mind, without the obligations. There's no such thing as entitlement, unless someone has first met an obligation"

This forced us to take any job offered to us. Anything. We once did a show in the middle of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia as part of a fashion show on a hot July night while all around our stage, a race-riot was fully underway. That's how serious we were about our vow."

Lois McMaster Bujold,"But pain... seems to me an insufficient reason not to embrace life. Being dead is quite painless. Pain, like time, is going to come on regardless. Question is, what glorious moments can you win from life in addition to the pain?"

Lois McMaster Bujold,"Experience suggests it doesn't matter so much how you got here, as what you do after you arrive."

Lois McMaster Bujold,"How could you be a Great Man if history brought you no Great Events, or brought you to them at the wrong time, too young, too old?"
Lois McMaster Bujold,I am who I choose to be. I always have been what I chose…though not always what I pleased.

Lois McMaster Bujold,It was never what I wanted to buy that held my heart's hope. It was what I wanted to be.

Warren Buffett,The only time to buy these is on a day with no 'y' in it.
Warren Buffett,I won't close down a business of subnormal profitability merely to add a fraction of a point to our corporate returns. I also feel it inappropriate for even an exceptionally profitable company to fund an operation once it appears to have unending losses in prospect. Adam Smith would disagree with my first proposition and Karl Marx would disagree with my second; the middle ground is the only position that leaves me comfortable.
Jimmy Buffett,"If we couldn't laugh, we would all go insane."
Jimmy Buffett,Indecision may or may not be my problem.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,"A self that is only differentiated - not integrated - may attain great individual accomplishments, but risks being mired in self-centered egotism.

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,"Repression is not the way to virtue. When people restrain themselves out of fear, their lives are by necessity diminished. Only through freely chosen discipline can life be enjoyed and still kept within the bounds of reason."
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,"The solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one's own powers. This is not to say that we should abandon every goal endorsed by society; rather, it means that, in addition to or instead of the goals others use to bribe us with, we develop a set of our own."
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi,There are two main strategies we can adopt to improve the quality of life. The first is to try making external conditions match our goals. The second is to change how we experience external conditions to make them fit our goals better.

Aleister Crowley,To read a newspaper is to refrain from reading something worthwhile.  The first discipline of education must therefore be to refuse resolutely to feed the mind with canned chatter.

Victor Cousin,"All men have an equal right to the free development of their faculties; they have an equal right to the impartial protection of the state; but it is not true, it is against all the laws of reason and equity, it is against the eternal nature of things, that the indolent man and the laborious man, the spendthrift and the economist, the imprudent and the wise, should obtain and enjoy an equal amount of goods."
Victor Cousin,True philosophy invents nothing; it merely establishes and describes what is.
Douglas Coupland,"Here’s my theory about meetings and life; the three things you can’t fake are erections, competence and creativity. That’s why meetings become toxic they put uncreative people in a situation in which they have to be something they can never be. And the more effort they put into concealing their inabilities, the more toxic the meeting becomes. One of the most common creativity-faking tactics is when someone puts their hands in prayer position and conceals their mouth while they nod at you and say, 'Mmmmmm. Interesting.' If pressed, they’ll add, 'I’ll have to get back to you on that.' Then they don’t say anything else."

The engineer simply cannot deny he did it. If his works do not work, he is damned."

Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: ""Is this real, or is this just a ride?"" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, ""Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."" And we kill those people."

Mitch Hedberg,"I don't own a cell phone or a pager. I just hang around everyone I know, all the time. If someone wants to get a hold of me, they just say 'Mitch,' and I say 'what?' and turn my head slightly."
Mitch Hedberg,"I haven't slept for ten days, because that would be too long."

Mitch Hedberg,"You know, you can't please all the people all the time... and last night, all those people were at my show."
Mitch Hedberg,"I like an escalator because an escalator can never break, it can only become stairs. There would never be an escalator temporarily out of order sign, only an escalator temporarily stairs. Sorry for the convenience."

Thomas Heatherwick,Any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have.
Mark Heath,Even the best of friends need time apart.
Alison Headley,"I always wrote with the idea that what I put out there is going to stay there. Once I publish something, it has been published. I've never deleted more than one or two posts from my site. I don't think that there are takebacks. I don't feel right about it."
Alison Headley,"In terms of being late or not starting at all, then it's never too late."

Judith Hayes,"If we are going to teach creation science as an alternative to evolution, then we should also teach the stork theory as an alternative to biological reproduction."
Judith Hayes,"The biblical account of Noah's Ark and the Flood is perhaps the most implausible story for fundamentalists to defend. Where, for example, while loading his ark, did Noah find penguins and polar bears in Palestine?"
Helen Hayes,"My mother drew a distinction between achievement and success. She said that 'achievement is the knowledge that you have studied and worked hard and done the best that is in you. Success is being praised by others, and that's nice, too, but not as important or satisfying. Always aim for achievement and forget about success.'"
Helen Hayes,"Every human being on this earth is born with a tragedy, and it isn't original sin. He's born with the tragedy that he has to grow up. That he has to leave the nest, the security, and go out to do battle. He has to lose everything that is lovely and fight for a new loveliness of his own making, and it's a tragedy. A lot of people don't have the courage to do it."
Salma Hayek,"Before you do anything, think. If you do something to try and impress someone, to be loved, accepted or even to get someone's attention, stop and think. So many people are busy trying to create an image, they die in the process."
Salma Hayek,"I have gotten a lot more attention than...other women that I find incredibly beautiful. And this has happened to me ever since I was a girl, when I was flat, had no teeth, was skinny and small as I could be. I always got more attention than anyone else. If I hadn't, I would have made sure I did."
Salma Hayek,"I'm a bit of an abstract figure that people can project their fantasies on; it's pretty much what we all are, otherwise we wouldn't be stars, and people wouldn't be interested. But people project things on you that have nothing to do with what you really are, or they see a little something and then exaggerate it. And you can't really control that."
Salma Hayek,"Life is tough, and if you have the ability to laugh at it you have the ability to enjoy it."
Salma Hayek,My driving abilities from Mexico have helped me get through Hollywood.
Salma Hayek,"People often say that 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder,' and I say that the most liberating thing about beauty is realizing that you are the beholder. This empowers us to find beauty in places where others have not dared to look, including inside ourselves."
Salma Hayek,It's very easy to feel someone's pain when you love them.
Salma Hayek,"The biggest thing [Frida] brought into my life was this peacefulness. I still get passionate about things, but my passion is not so scattered and it's not needy. It's a lot more powerful because it comes with this groundedness and peacefulness. That it's about the process, not about the results."
Benjamin Haydon,"Never suffer youth to be an excuse for inadequacy, nor age and fame to be an excuse for indolence."
John Hay,True luck consists not in holding the best of the cards at the table; luckiest is he who knows just when to rise and go home.

Stephen Hawking,"For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imaginations, we learned to talk."

Stephen Hawking,My publisher told me that the number of readers of this book will be inversely proportional to the number of equations it contains.
Stephen Hawking,We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the Universe. That makes us something very special.
Stephen Hawking,"I think that it's important for scientists to explain their work, particularly in cosmology. This now answers many questions once asked of religion."
Stephen Hawking,"If human life were long enough to find the ultimate theory, everything would have been solved by previous generations. Nothing would be left to be discovered."
Stephen Hawking,It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on with life and I haven't done badly. People won't have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.

Jane Austen,"If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out."
Jane Austen,"It will, I believe, be everywhere found, that as the clergy are, or are not what they ought to be, so are the rest of the nation."
Jane Austen,Nothing amuses me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves.

Jane Austen,The enthusiasm of a woman's love is even beyond the biographer's.

Jane Austen,"We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be."
Jane Austen,"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or...of something else."
Jane Austen,"But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty surrounding families cannot prevent her. Something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way."
Jane Austen,Friendship is certainly the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.

W. H. Auden, And shares our bed and eats at our own table.
W. H. Auden,False enchantment can last a lifetime.
W. H. Auden,"Murder is unique in that it abolishes the party it injures, so that society has to take the place of the victim and on his behalf demand atonement or grant forgiveness; it is the one crime in which society has a direct interest."

W. H. Auden,"like some valley cheese,"
W. H. Auden,"local, but prized elsewhere."
Margaret Atwood,"Another belief of mine: that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise."
Margaret Atwood,"Or perhaps she's just softening me up: she's a Baptist, she'd like me to find Jesus, or vice versa, before it's too late. That kind of thing doesn't run in her family: her mother Reenie never went in much for God. There was mutual respect, and if you were in trouble, naturally you'd call on him, as with lawyers, but as with lawyers, it would have to be bad trouble. Otherwise it didn't pay to get too mixed up with him."
Clement Attlee,"Democracy means government by discussion, but it is only effective if you can stop people talking."
Eli Attie,"Grief is Newark. It's there. Can't avoid it. The idea is to hold your nose, hope the traffic's not too bad and get on to Manhattan as quickly as possible."

Gordon Atkinson,No one forgives with more grace and love than a child.
Gordon Atkinson,I write because I'm afraid to say some things out loud.
Gordon Atkinson,Knowing that there is worse pain doesn't make present pain hurt any less.
Gordon Atkinson,"One of the joys we have in being human is in exercising our freedom to choose and to take each case as it comes to us. We are not robots who are forced into behaviors by their programming. We see things; we think about things; and we choose our course of action or beliefs appropriately. And as long as that remains true of us, we will live every day of our lives on one slippery slope or another. There is no reason to fear this."
Gordon Atkinson,"When someone is giving you their theology, their God words, you should listen hard and be very gentle. The time to deliver your God words is when you are asked."
Gordon Atkinson,"Dignity comes not from control, but from understanding who you are and taking your rightful place in the world."

Gordon Atkinson,"The human heart cannot love the whole world. And if you try to put the whole world into your heart, you will eventually lose touch with your own humanity."
Gordon Atkinson,One thing is clear to me. You can't know everything you'd like to know. You can't do everything you'd like to do. You can't read everything you'd like to read. You must hold onto some things and let go of others. Learning to make that choice is one of the big lessons of this life.
Gordon Atkinson,Good writing takes more than just time; it wants your best moments and the best of you.
Gordon Atkinson,"It's not foresight or hindsight we need. We need sight, plain and simple. We need to see what is right in front of us."
Gordon Atkinson,"When life seems chaotic, you don't need people giving you easy answers or cheap promises. There might not be any answers to your problems. What you need is a safe place where you can bounce with people who have taken some bad hops of their own."
Gordon Atkinson,"I’m telling you, things are getting out of hand. Or maybe I’m discovering that things were never in my hands."
Gordon Atkinson,There isn’t much better in this life than finding a way to spend a few hours in conversation with people you respect and love. You have to carve this time out of your life because you aren’t really living without it.

Elizabeth Aston,"One's life is not as fixed as one believes. Surprises may lie in store for you, the unexpected often tends to happen, sometimes bringing in its train the most delightful change in one's life or circumstances."
Elizabeth Aston,"The first rule of life is to reveal nothing, to be exceptionally cautious in what you say, in whatever company you may find yourself. If you have a secret, you have only to whisper it to your dearest friend with the strictest injunction that it will go no further, and within half a day the story is all over town, and when you do make what would seem to be a perfectly sensible remark, you will find it reported in the most grotesque form, thus incurring no end of criticism to rebound upon you."

Elizabeth Aston,How close the sexes sometimes come to one another. It is as much a matter of behaviour and the spere in which they move that separates the masculine part of humanity from the feminine.
Elizabeth Aston,It is a sadness of growing older that we lose our ardent appreciation of what is new and different and difficult.
Elizabeth Aston,"Mountains inspire awe in any human person who has a soul. They remind us of our frailty, our unimportance, of the briefness of our span upon this earth. They touch the heavens, and sail serenely at an altitude beyond even the imaginings of a mere mortal."
Elizabeth Aston,"One remembers horrors, I think, for the rest of one's life, but memories do not always remain so sharp, and with time, and new circumstance, do not affect us so powerfully."
Elizabeth Aston,One's first love is always perfect until one meets one's second love.
Elizabeth Aston,"There was no escaping by means of any journey, however adventurous, one took one's problems and sorrows with one."
Elizabeth Aston,"You can't jump down the stairs in one leap, however much you might wish to, and you even more surely can't jump up it, but one step and then the next and there you are, at the top or the bottom and not a bit out of breath or discomposed."
Elizabeth Aston,Clergymen have much the same in their breeches as other men.

David Assael,Sometimes it's hard to avoid the happiness of others.
David Assael,"After you've been in a place for a while, everything starts to look... I won't say better, there's no need to go to extremes...but your everyday life does start to become...familiar."
David Assael,"Well, spring sprang. We've had our state of grace and our little gift of sanctioned madness, courtesy of Mother Nature. Thanks, Gaia. Much obliged. I guess it's time to get back to that daily routine of living we like to call normal."

Isaac Asimov,"Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest."
Isaac Asimov,"Science can be introduced to children well or poorly. If poorly, children can be turned away from science; they can develop a lifelong antipathy; they will be in a far worse condition than if they had never been introduced to science at all."
Isaac Asimov,"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' (I found it!) but 'That's funny ...'"
Isaac Asimov,"You must keep sending work out; you must never let a manuscript do nothing but eat its head off in a drawer. You send that work out again and again, while you're working on another one. If you have talent, you will receive some measure of success - but only if you persist."
Isaac Asimov,"One, a robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm;"
Isaac Asimov,"Two, a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; Three, a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws."

Sir Eric Ashby,"The engineer is the key figure in the material progress of the world. It is his engineering that makes a reality of the potential value of science by translating scientific knowledge into tools, resources, energy and labor to bring them into the service of man ... To make contributions of this kind the engineer requires the imagination to visualize the needs of society and to appreciate what is possible as well as the technological and broad social age understanding to bring his vision to reality."

Heather Armstrong,He can make me love something just by showing me the energy with which he loves it.
Heather Armstrong,"That’s the miracle of babies, their ability to lay bare the tender, beating hearts of raging assholes."
Heather Armstrong,"That’s sort of a cliché about parents. We all believe that our children are the most beautiful children in the world. But the thing is, what no one really talks about is the fact that we all really believe it."
Heather Armstrong,"People often write me and ask how I keep my wood floors so clean when I live with a child and a dog, and my answer is that I use a technique called Suffering From a Mental Illness."
Heather Armstrong,"This is part of the essence of motherhood, watching your kid grow into her own person and not being able to do anything about it. Otherwise children would be nothing more than pets."
Heather Armstrong,"I have to live the content, then come back and write about it."

J. B. S. Haldane,"We do not know, in most cases, how far social failure and success are due to heredity, and how far to environment. But environment is the easier of the two to improve."
J. B. S. Haldane,"My own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we *can* suppose."
J. B. S. Haldane,"To the biologist the problem of socialism appears largely as a problem of size. The extreme socialists desire to run every nation as a single business concern. I do not suppose that Henry Ford would find much difficulty in running Andorra or Luxembourg on a socialistic basis. He has already more men on his pay-roll than their population. It is conceivable that a syndicate of Fords, if we could find them, would make Belgium Ltd. or Denmark Inc. pay their way. But while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious possibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely socialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a hippopotamus jumping a hedge."
Ken Hakuta,Lack of money is no obstacle. Lack of an idea is an obstacle.
Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey,"Please write again soon. Though my own life is filled with activity, letters encourage momentary escape into others lives and I come back to my own with greater contentment."
Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey,Time is a cruel thief to rob us of our former selves. We lose as much to life as we do to death.
Jonathan Haidt,"Gossip and reputation make sure that what comes around-a person who is cruel will find that the others are cruel hack to him, and a person who is kind will find others are kind in return. Gossip paired with reciprocity allow karma to work here on earth, not in the next life."
Jonathan Haidt,"In real life, however, you don't react to what someone did; you react only to what you think she did, and the gap between action and perception is bridged by the art of impression management. If life itself is but what you deem it, then why not focus your efforts on persuading others to believe that you are a virtuous and trustworthy cooperator?"
Jonathan Haidt,"Many species reciprocate, but only humans gossip, and much of what we gossip about is the vale of other people as partners for reciprocal relationships."
Jonathan Haidt,"Nothing is miserable unless you think it so; and on the other hand, nothing brings happiness unless you are content with it."
Jonathan Haidt,"Once you understand the power of stimulus control, you can use it to your advantage by changing the stimuli in your environment and avoiding undesirable ones; or, if that's not possible, by filling your consciousness with thoughts about their less tempting aspects."
Jonathan Haidt,"Scandal is great entertainment because it allows people to feel contempt, a moral emotion that gives feeling of moral superiority while asking nothing in return."
Jonathan Haidt,"The final moment of success is often no more thrilling than taking off a heavy backpack at the end of a long hike. If you went on the hike only to feel that pleasure, you are a fool. Yet people sometimes do just this. They work hard at a task and expect some special euphoria at the end. But when they achieve success and find only moderate and short-lived pleasure, they ask is that all there is? They devalue their accomplishments as a striving after wind. We can call this the progress principle: Pleasure comes more from making progress toward goals than from achieving them."
H. Rider Haggard,"As I grow older , I regret to say that a detestable habit of thinking seems to be getting a hold of me."
Captain J. A. Hadfield,This art of resting the mind and the power of dismissing from it all care and worry is probably one of the secrets of energy in our great men.
Hadewijch of Antwerp,"May your service of love a beautiful thing; want nothing else, fear nothing else and let love be free to become what love truly is."

Noelie Altito,The shortest distance between two points is under construction.
Lisa Alther,"Just as you began to feel that you could make good use of time, there was no time left to you."

Steve Almond,Nothing on Earth so beautiful as the final haul on Halloween night.
Dorothy Allison,"Change, when it comes, cracks everything open."

Woody Allen,I'm astounded by people who want to 'know' the universe when it's hard enough to find your way around Chinatown.
Woody Allen,"If it turns out that there is a God, I don't think that he's evil. But the worst that you can say about him is that basically he's an underachiever."
Woody Allen,If only God would give me some clear sign! Like making a large deposit in my name in a Swiss bank.
Woody Allen,"Interestingly, according to modern astronomers, space is finite. This is a very comforting thought-- particularly for people who can never remember where they have left things."
Woody Allen,It is impossible to experience one's death objectively and still carry a tune.
Woody Allen,"It is impossible to travel faster than the speed of light, and certainly not desirable, as one's hat keeps blowing off."
Woody Allen,It seemed the world was divided into good and bad people. The good ones slept better... while the bad ones seemed to enjoy the waking hours much more.
Woody Allen,Life is divided into the horrible and the miserable.
Roger Allen,"In case you're worried about what's going to become of the younger generation, it's going to grow up and start worrying about the younger generation."
Robert G. Allen,Many an optimist has become rich by buying out a pessimist.
John Allen,"One would think that if you're anonymous, you'd do anything you want, but groups have their own sense of community and what we can do."
John Allen,The thing that I'm always left with is this overwhelming desire for people to be rooted and the only way that they feel rooted is through another person.
James Lane Allen,You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.

Fred Allen,Hanging is too good for a man who makes puns; he should be drawn and quoted.
Fred Allen,Hollywood is a place where people from Iowa mistake each other for stars.
Fred Allen,I can't understand why a person will take a year to write a novel when he can easily buy one for a few dollars.
Fred Allen,Imitation is the sincerest form of television.
Fred Allen,"What's on your mind, if you will allow the overstatement?"
Fred Allen,"You can take all the sincerity in Hollywood, place it in the navel of a firefly and still have room enough for three caraway seeds and a producer's heart."
Fred Allen,[Television is] the triumph of machine over people.
Fred Allen,I have just returned from Boston. It is the only sane thing to do if you find yourself up there.
Fred Allen,Television is a new medium. It's called a medium because nothing is well-done.

Mitch Albom,"The most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love, and to let it come in."
Mitch Albom,"And in that line now was a whiskered old man, with a linen cap and a crooked nose, who waited in a place called the Stardust Band Shell to share his part of the secret of heaven: that each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one."

Mitch Albom,"Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else."

Jessica Alba,My theory is that if you look confident you can pull off anything - even if you have no clue what you're doing.
Daniel Akst,At least one study of blocked writers has found that they were more productive and more creative when they were essentially forced to write instead of scribbling only when the mood struck them.
Daniel Akst,"Be systematically heroic in little unnecessary points, do every day or two something for no other reason than its difficulty, so that, when the hour of need draws nigh, it may find you not unnerved or untrained to stand the test."
Daniel Akst,"Besides, what matters, when it comes to self-control, isn't so much willpower as vision-the ability to see the future, so that the long-run consequences of our short-run choices are vividly clear. In that sense, our shortcomings in this arena are really failures of imagination."
Daniel Akst,"Exercising self-restraint can be depleting, yet it can also be ennobling."
Daniel Akst,"In matters of self-control as we shall see again and again, speed kills. But a little friction really can save lives."
Daniel Akst,"In the modern world, self-control buys a good life indeed. Having self-control to spare is rare enough nowadays that the marketplace lavishes huge rewards on society's scary new self-control elite, those lords of discipline who not only withstood all that boring stuff in graduate school, but keep themselves thin by carefully regulating what they eat after flogging themselves off to the gym at the crack of dawn. It's as if they got the news ahead of the rest of us-no doubt by waking up earlier-that self-control may well be the most important trait of the twenty-first century."
Daniel Akst,"Maybe it would be better to acknowledge, like the Greeks, that a lot of behavior we call addiction is really a love of pleasure that carries the force of habit. We become addicted mostly because of the central issue in all self-control problems, which is the disproportionate value we place on short-term rewards."
Daniel Akst,"Our choices add up; each one influences others, and cumulatively a series of delightful short-term choices can leave us much worse off in the long run."
Daniel Akst,"Self-regulation will always be a challenge, but if somebody's going to be in charge, it might as well be me."
Daniel Akst,"What mattered was not what happens to you, but how you handle it. Self-command is required to overcome the dangerous misinformation of our emotions, and because for the most part the self is the only thing that we can command. We have no control, ultimately, over what people do or think. What we can influence is our understanding of these circumstances and how we respond to them."
Daniel Akst,"What self-control doesn't mean is mindless self-sacrifice or knee-jerk self-denial. On the contrary, it represents an affirmation of self, for it requires not the negation of instinct but its integration into a more complete form of character-one that takes account of more than just immediate pleasures and pains. The self-control I'm talking about means acting in keeping with your highest level of reflection."
Daniel Akst,"When we exercise self-control on a given occasion, we win for ourselves a little credibility we can rely on the next time around. Pretty soon we develop a reputation to ourselves that we want badly to uphold. With each test that we meet, our resolve gains momentum, fueled by the fear that we may succumb and establish a damaging precedent for our own weakness."
Daniel Akst,"While we don't have much say over the desires that we have, we certainly can decide which we prefer-and then search for ways to act on that basis."

Alfred Adler,It is easier to fight for one's principles than to live up to them.
Martin Sage and Sybil Adelman,"In Kyudo philosophy, you don't aim--you become one with the target. Then, in fact, there's nothing to aim at. I find it works well with women, too. Give it a try."
Martin Sage and Sybil Adelman,"Most of you have been where I am tonight. The crash site of unrequited love. You ask yourself, How did I get here? What was it about? Was it her smile? Was it the way she crossed her legs, the turn of her ankle, the poignant vulnerability of her slender wrists? What are these elusive and ephemeral things that ignite passion in the human heart? That's an age-old question. It's perfect food for thought on a bright midsummer's night."
Martin Sage and Sybil Adelman,"Obsessions and fixations are not really my field. All I know, when the mind really grabs hold of something, look out."
Martin Sage and Sybil Adelman,Think about a woman. Doesn't know you're thinking about her. Doesn't care you're thinking about her. Makes you think about her even more.

Joseph Addison,"If you wish success in life, make perseverance your bosom friend, experience your wise counselor, caution your elder brother and hope your guardian genius."
Joseph Addison,"It is folly for an eminent person to think of escaping censure, and a weakness to be affected by it.

There is no defense against reproach but obscurity; it is a kind of concomitant to greatness, as satires and invectives were an essential part of a Roman triumph."

Scott Adams,"The best part about being my age is in knowing how my life worked out. Sure, there's a lot more living to go, but there isn't much doubt that I'll always be the 'Dilbert guy.' Unless I go on a crime spree, in which case I'll be 'that stabbin' Dilbert guy.'"
Scott Adams,"Frankly, I’m suspicious of anyone who has a strong opinion on a complicated issue."
Scott Adams,"Ask a deeply religious Christian if he'd rather live next to a bearded Muslim that may or may not be plotting a terror attack, or an atheist that may or may not show him how to set up a wireless network in his house. On the scale of prejudice, atheists don't seem so bad lately."
Scott Adams,You haven’t achieved equality until you’re a legitimate target for humor.
Scott Adams,"Men want sex. If men ruled the world, they could get sex anywhere, anytime. Restaurants would give you sex instead of breath mints on the way out. Gas stations would give sex with every fill-up. Banks would give sex to anyone who opened a checking account."

Scott Adams," Love like you need money,"
Scott Adams, Work when people are watching.

John Adams,"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution is designed only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for any other."

Ansel Adams,"'To the complaint, 'There are no people in these photographs,' I respond, 'There are always two people: the photographer and the viewer.'"
Ansel Adams,I have often thought that if photography were difficult in the true sense of the term -- meaning that the creation of a simple photograph would entail as much time and effort as the production of a good watercolor or etching -- there would be a vast improvement in total output.

But caregiving does buttonhole you; you're stitched in one place."

Diane Ackerman,"Words are such small things, like confetti in the brain, and yet they are color and clarify everything, they can stain the mind or warp the feelings."
Diane Ackerman,"Working from home meant we could vary snack and coffee breaks, change our desks or view, goof off, drink on the job, even spend the day in pajamas, and often meet to gossip or share ideas.

Sir Arthur Eddington,"For the truth of the conclusions of physical science, observation is the supreme Court of Appeal. It does not follow that every item which we confidently accept as physical knowledge has actually been certified by the Court; our confidence is that it would be certified by the Court if it were submitted. But it does follow that every item of physical knowledge is of a form which might be submitted to the Court. It must be such that we can specify (although it may be impracticable to carry out) an observational procedure which would decide whether it is true or not. Clearly a statement cannot be tested by observation unless it is an assertion about the results of observation. Every item of physical knowledge must therefore be an assertion of what has been or would be the result of carrying out a specified observational procedure."

They select, combine, and test, seeking to find order in their experiences - ""which is the mostest? which is the leastest?""

Erich Fromm,"That man can destroy life is just as miraculous a feat as that he can create it, for life is the miracle, the inexplicable. In the act of destruction, man sets himself above life; he transcends himself as a creature. Thus, the ultimate choice for a man, inasmuch as he is driven to transcend himself, is to create or to destroy, to love or to hate."

It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban housewife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night, she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question: 'Is this all?'"
Betty Friedan,The problem that has no name - which is simply the fact that American women are kept from growing to their full human capacities - is taking a far greater toll on the physical and mental health of our country than any known disease.
Betty Friedan,"There needs to be bolder thinking, ... on how to measure the quality of life of men and women in the work force. Currently, success is measured by material advancements.

Henry W. Fowler,"Quotation ... A writer expresses himself in words that have been used before because they give his meaning better than he can give it himself, or because they are beautiful or witty, or because he expects them to touch a cord of association in his reader, or because he wishes to show that he is learned and well read.

In other cases, to get the best work out of people you may have to pretend you are not their boss and let them treat someone else like the boss, and then that whispers to you behind a fake wall and you tell them what to tell the first person. Contrary to what I believed as a little girl, being the boss almost never involves marching around, waving your arms, and chanting, "" I am the boss! I am the boss!"""

Tina Fey,"When people say, ""You really, really must"" do something, it means you don't really have to. no one ever says, ""You really, really must deliver the baby during labor."" When it's true, it doesn't need to be said."

They hate men - that's their problem."
Jerry Falwell,The argument that making contraceptives available to young people would prevent teen pregnancies is ridiculous. That's like offering a cookbook as a cure to people who are trying to lose weight.
